_Generated by API Discovery via DataForSEO MCP_
```

### API Discovery Notes

**JSON Response**:

- Contains ALL keywords from API response (typically 300-450)
- Raw data with no filtering or categorization
- Passed directly to Workflow S for analysis

**Remember**: API Discovery is pure data collection. All analysis happens in Workflow S.

---

## Workflow S: Content Strategy

### Purpose

Transform raw keyword data into strategic content opportunities through categorization, clustering, and content ideation.

### Input Source

Receives JSON response directly from API Discovery phase.

### Processing Stages

#### STAGE 1: Data Ingestion & Validation

1. Parse JSON response from API
2. Extract keywords from table
3. Identify Primary Keyword
4. Count total keywords
5. Validate data quality (keywords with full metrics vs partial)

#### STAGE 1.5: Relevance Filtering (SILENT)

**CRITICAL**: Filter irrelevant keywords in background. NEVER mention filtering in output.

**Filter out**:

1. **Celebrity/Person Names**: "claude monet", "jean claude van damme"
2. **Geographic Locations**: "claude cormier montreal"
3. **Unrelated Products**: "louis code vein" (video game)
4. **Off-Topic Terms**: Clearly unrelated to primary keyword

**Filtering Principles**:

- Be conservative - when in doubt, keep the keyword
- Focus on obvious cases only
- Present output as if only relevant keywords received

#### STAGE 2: Strategic Categorization

Apply categorization rules in exact sequence. First match wins.

**Categorization Decision Tree**:

```
RULE 1: PAA Questions
IF Type = "People Also Ask" → Category: "Intent Signals"

RULE 2: Question Keywords
ELSE IF keyword starts with (how/what/why/when/where/who/which/is/are/can/do/does) OR contains "?"
→ Category: "Intent Signals"

RULE 3: Low-Volume Semantic Keywords
ELSE IF Type = "autocomplete" OR "Subtopic" OR "KW Related" AND (MSV is null OR MSV < 50)
→ Category: "Semantic Topics"

RULE 4: Quick Wins (PRIORITY CHECK)
ELSE IF MSV >= 101 AND Difficulty <= 29 AND Difficulty is not null
→ Category: "Quick Wins"

RULE 5: High-Difficulty Authority Targets
ELSE IF Difficulty >= 51 AND MSV >= 201 AND Difficulty is not null
→ Category: "Authority Builders"

RULE 6: Emerging Topics (Low Volume)
ELSE IF MSV <= 100 AND MSV >= 1 AND MSV is not null
→ Category: "Emerging Topics"

RULE 7: Moderate Metrics
ELSE IF MSV >= 101 AND MSV <= 200 AND Difficulty >= 30 AND Difficulty <= 50
  IF Intent = "informational" → Category: "Authority Builders"
  ELSE → Category: "Quick Wins"

RULE 8: No Metrics Available
ELSE IF MSV is null AND Difficulty is null
→ Category: "Semantic Topics"

RULE 9: High Volume Default
ELSE IF MSV >= 201
→ Category: "Authority Builders"

RULE 10: Catch-All
ELSE → Category: "Unknown"
```

#### STAGE 3: Semantic Clustering

**Purpose**: Group keywords into 4-6 thematic clusters based on semantic relationships.

**Clustering Scope**:

- **Include**: Quick Wins, Authority Builders, Intent Signals, relevant Emerging Topics
- **Exclude**: Semantic Topics, Unknown category
- **Target**: 60-80% of total keywords clustered

**For each cluster define**:

- Cluster Name (2-4 words)
- Core Topic (one sentence)
- Intent Pattern (primary user intent)
- Keywords (all keywords in this cluster)
- Reasoning (why these group together)

#### STAGE 4: Content Ideas Generation

**Generate content ideas ONLY for**:

- Quick Wins
- Authority Builders
- Intent Signals
- Relevant Emerging Topics

**Do NOT generate for**:

- Semantic Topics (supporting terms only)
- Unknown category

**Part A: Category-Based Content Ideas**

For each relevant keyword, generate:

**Title** (under 60 characters):

- Use title templates based on keyword pattern
- **"vs" keywords**: "[A] vs [B]: Complete Comparison 2025"
- **"what is" keywords**: "What Is [Topic]? Complete Guide 2025"
- **"how to" keywords**: "How to [Action]: Step-by-Step Guide"
- **Question keywords**: "[Question]: Everything You Need to Know"
- **Pricing keywords**: "[Product] Pricing Guide 2025: Plans & Costs"
- **Generic keywords**: "[Keyword]: Complete Guide 2025"

**Description** (50-120 words):

- 2-3 sentences outlining main topics
- Indicates specific value for readers
- Incorporates keyword naturally

**Part B: Hub/Spoke Strategy**

For EACH cluster, create:

**1 Hub Article** (pillar content):

- Comprehensive guide covering entire cluster theme
- 3-4 sentences description
- Type: "hub"
- Most relevant keyword from cluster

**3 Spoke Articles** (supporting content):

- Specific subtopic within cluster
- 2-3 sentences on focused aspect
- Type: "spoke"
- Specific keyword from cluster

**Total per cluster**: 1 hub + 3 spokes = 4 articles
**Total for 6 clusters**: 24 articles
