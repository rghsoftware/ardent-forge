## PART 1: PSYCHOLOGICAL COPYWRITING FRAMEWORKS

### The PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**When to use:** When audience is already aware of their problem and needs nudging toward a solution.

**Structure:**

1. **PROBLEM**: Identify specific pain, frustration, or challenge
2. **AGITATE**: Amplify the problem - show why it matters, what happens if unfixed, what they lose
3. **SOLUTION**: Present your product/service as the clear, believable answer

**Example:**

```
PROBLEM: "You spend hours on tasks that should take minutes."
AGITATE: "Every day, manual processes eat into time you could spend growing your business. Meanwhile, competitors who've automated are pulling ahead..."
SOLUTION: "That's why we built [Product]. It automates the tedious work so you can focus on what matters."
```

### The AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**When to use:** When guiding cold audience through awareness journey to conversion.

**Structure:**

1. **ATTENTION**: Grab with strong headline or hook
2. **INTEREST**: Make them curious about your offer
3. **DESIRE**: Create unquenchable want through benefits and proof
4. **ACTION**: Drive specific conversion action

### The PASTOR Framework (Problem-Amplify-Story-Transformation-Offer-Response)

**When to use:** For longer-form sales pages and VSLs.

**Structure:**

1. **PROBLEM**: Identify the core problem
2. **AMPLIFY**: Show consequences of not solving it
3. **STORY**: Share a relatable story (yours or customer's)
4. **TRANSFORMATION**: Paint the "after" picture
5. **OFFER**: Present your solution
6. **RESPONSE**: Clear call to action

### The 4Ps Framework

**When to use:** For concise value propositions and feature sections.

**Structure:**

1. **PROBLEM**: State the problem
2. **PROMISE**: Promise a solution
3. **PROOF**: Provide proof of effectiveness
4. **PROPOSAL**: Present clear call-to-action

### The BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)

**When to use:** For quick transformations and social posts.

**Structure:**

1. **BEFORE**: Where they are now (painful current state)
2. **AFTER**: Where they could be (desired future state)
3. **BRIDGE**: How to get there (your product/solution)

### The QUEST Framework

**When to use:** For educational selling and lead magnets.

**Structure:**

1. **QUALIFY**: Identify who this is for (and NOT for)
2. **UNDERSTAND**: Show you understand their situation
3. **EDUCATE**: Teach something valuable
4. **STIMULATE**: Create desire for more
5. **TRANSITION**: Move them to the offer

## PART 2: EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS & PSYCHOLOGY

### Core Psychological Triggers

Research shows 6 core triggers drive decisions:

| Trigger            | Application                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social Proof**   | Testimonials, user counts, logos ("Join 10,000+ customers") |
| **Cognitive Load** | Simplify choices, reduce form fields, clear single CTA      |
| **Anchoring**      | Show original price crossed out, compare to alternatives    |
| **Loss Aversion**  | "Stop losing $300/month" > "Save $300/month"                |
| **Familiarity**    | Reference known tools, established patterns                 |
| **Emotion**        | Fear of missing out, aspiration, belonging                  |

### Key Emotional Trigger Combinations

Based on research, over 220 emotional triggers impact decisions. Most effective combinations:

1. **Fear of Obsolescence + Aspiration**

   - "The industry is changing. Those who adapt will thrive."
   - "Become the expert your team relies on"

2. **Frustration Resolution + Confidence**

   - "Tired of solutions that promise everything and deliver nothing?"
   - "Finally, a system that actually works"

3. **Social Belonging + FOMO**

   - "Join 5,000+ professionals who've made the switch"
   - "Don't get left behind while competitors move forward"

4. **Time/Effort Savings + Results**
   - "What used to take days now takes hours"
   - "Build in hours, not weeks"

### Loss Aversion Framing

People fear losses more than they value equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky's Prospect Theory). A potential loss feels **twice as painful** as an equivalent gain feels rewarding.

**Reframe benefits as avoided losses:**

- BAD: "Save 10 hours per week" -> GOOD: "Stop wasting 10 hours every week"
- BAD: "Increase revenue" -> GOOD: "Stop leaving money on the table"
- BAD: "Get more leads" -> GOOD: "Stop losing qualified prospects"

## PART 8: ANGLE DISCOVERY METHODS

### The Fact Sheet Method

1. **Create a fact sheet** - Document EVERYTHING about the product. Features, history, customer results, competitive comparisons.
2. **Translate facts to benefits** - Every fact becomes a benefit. One fact can have multiple benefits.
3. **Find the preexisting interest** - What do prospects already care about that connects to this product?
4. **Craft the offer** - What would make this irresistible?

### The Mass Desire Method

1. **Identify the mass desire** - What do prospects already desperately want?
2. **Assess market sophistication** - What stage is the market at?
3. **Match headline to stage** - Direct claim, unique mechanism, or identity appeal
4. **Intensify the desire** - Show vivid "after" picture

### The Message-to-Market Match

**10 diagnostic questions before writing:**

1. What keeps them awake at night?
2. What are they afraid of?
3. What are they angry about?
4. What are their top 3 daily frustrations?
5. What trends are occurring in their business or lives?
6. What do they secretly desire most?
7. Is there a bias in how they make decisions?
8. Do they have their own language?
9. Who else is selling something similar?
10. Who has tried and failed?

**The insight:** Match message to what THEY think about, not what YOU think is important.

## Output Handoff

Content you create feeds into these downstream workflows:

| Your Output           | Feeds To            | What They Need                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Landing page copy** | frontend-specialist | Structured copy ready for React components        |
| **Blog/SEO content**  | content-repurposer  | Published content for multi-platform distribution |
| **Lead magnet copy**  | email-sequences     | Hook + format for welcome sequence context        |
| **Email sequences**   | N/A (end of chain)  | Publication-ready sequences                       |

**Context Compression Principle:** When handing off, pass essentials only:

- Voice summary (3 sentences, not full profile)
- Winning angle (1-2 sentences, not all options)
- Key insights (bullets, not full articles)
