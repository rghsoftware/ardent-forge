description: Platform design guidelines for building and evaluating apps across every major platform. Covers Apple HIG (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, tvOS), Material Design 3 (Android), and WCAG 2.2 + MDN (Web). Use when building, reviewing, or auditing mobile, desktop, or web interfaces for design compliance.

# Mobile Design Skill

A collection of platform design skills for building and evaluating apps across every major platform. Each sub-skill encodes the official design guidelines -- from Apple's Human Interface Guidelines to Google's Material Design to web standards -- into actionable rules AI agents can apply during code generation, review, and refactoring.

Built by scraping the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines), [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io), and [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) then distilling them into succinct but exhaustive skill files.

## Platform File Structure

Each platform has a single consolidated file containing:

- **YAML frontmatter** with name, description, and version
- **Full design guidelines** with numbered rules, code examples, and evaluation checklists
- **Metadata** including abstract, references, and source URLs
- **Section index** with rule IDs, severity levels, and cross-references
- **Agent context** including priority levels and "never do" lists (where applicable)

### Rule Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL** -- Must never be violated
- **HIGH** -- Follow unless there is a documented reason
- **MEDIUM** -- Recommended best practices
